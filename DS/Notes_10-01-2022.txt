1.Linked List: A linked list is a linear data structure.
              - LinkedList is not stored in a contiguous memory location.
Types : - Singly
        - Doubly
        - Circular

-In singly linked list is in node have data and address of next node.Last node have address value is NULL.
-In Doubly linked list each node have data and address of previous and next node.
-Circular linked list is singly linked list in which last element contains address od first node.

-> Advantages: dynamic data structure
               No memory wastage
               Easy implementation

-> Disadv.: Memory Usage
            Traversal



2.Recursion: It is a technique in which function calls it self.

 -> Recursion is made for solving problems that can be broken down into smaller, 
    repetitive problems. 

Adv.: Reduce length of code.
     Reduce unnecessary calling of function.

DisAdv.: Slower than non-recursive function
         Require more Memory


3.Time Complexity: Time taken by code to execute.

Depends on some factors like system, code etc.

-> Frequency count: How many time statement executed.

*Big O notation:
We can express algorithmic complexity using the big-O notation.
For a problem of size N:

-constant-time: O(1)
-linear-time : O(n)
-quadratic-time : O(N^2)
